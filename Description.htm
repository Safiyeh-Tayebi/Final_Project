    <h1>Population Resilience to Heat Stress in New Jersey</h1>

    <p>This project investigates the resilience of populations in New Jersey to heat-related stresses using a mix of geospatial methods. The analysis integrates multiple datasets, exploring socioeconomic and environmental factors that influence vulnerability and adaptive capacity.</p>

    <p>The study aims to provide insights into how urban planning, socioeconomic factors, and environmental conditions intersect to influence population resilience to heat stresses. The results are intended to support policymakers and urban planners in designing interventions for climate adaptation and equity. This project utilizes geospatial data to assess population resilience. The datasets include climate-environmental, infrastructural, health-related, and demographic variables, each contributing positively or negatively to vulnerability and resilience indices.</p>

    <h2>Resilience Index</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Resilience Index</strong> is a composite metric designed to measure the ability of populations to adapt to and recover from heat stresses. It balances vulnerability factors against resilience factors within the framework of the <strong>Vulnerability-Resilience Trade-Off (VRT)</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Vulnerability Factors:</strong> Indicators that increase the risk of adverse outcomes during heat stresses (e.g., low income, elderly population, chronic diseases).</li>
        <li><strong>Resilience Factors:</strong> Indicators that enhance the capacity to withstand and recover from heat stresses (e.g., access to healthcare, presence of cooling centers, community support systems).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Resilience Index = Resilience Score - Vulnerability Score</p>
    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Positive values indicate higher resilience.</li>
        <li>Negative values indicate higher vulnerability.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Resilience Index reflects the <strong>adaptive capacity</strong> of a population by quantifying both its weaknesses (vulnerabilities) and strengths (resilience). The logic includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifying At-Risk Populations:</strong> Highlight areas with high vulnerability and low resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Guiding Resource Allocation:</strong> Direct investments like cooling centers and healthcare facilities to areas with low resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Supporting Policy Decisions:</strong> Provide data-driven insights for climate adaptation strategies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sources</h2>
    <p>This data is collected from the following sources:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/">NJGIN Open Data</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-features/hvi/">Environment and Health Data Portal</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/Applications/heatTracker/">CDC Heat Tracker</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www-doh.nj.gov/doh-shad/topic/Mortality.html">New Jersey State Department of Health</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data are in ZECTA scale and were updated between 2020 and 2023. Except for cooling center locations (GeoJSON file), all others were in CSV format. A spatial join was used for data preparation (e.g., the number of cooling centers for each ZECTA) and mapping. For accessibility to cooling centers, a network analysis was performed.</p>
