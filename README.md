- **Overview**: This project explores the **Resilience Index** of populations across New Jersey at the zip code scale. The index evaluates:
  - How well communities withstand and recover from **heat stresses**, a growing concern due to climate change.
  - Combines two measures:
    - **Vulnerability Score**: Reflects susceptibility to heat stresses based on age, socioeconomic status, and infrastructure limitations.
    - **Resilience Score**: Measures the ability to adapt, recover, and thrive, considering factors like access to cooling infrastructure, healthcare, and socioeconomic stability.
