- **Overview**: This project explores the **Resilience Index** of populations across New Jersey at the zip code scale. The index evaluates:
  - How well communities withstand and recover from **heat stresses**, a growing concern due to climate change.
  - Combines two measures:
    - **Vulnerability Score**: Reflects susceptibility to heat stresses based on age, socioeconomic status, and infrastructure limitations.
    - **Resilience Score**: Measures the ability to adapt, recover, and thrive, considering factors like access to cooling infrastructure, healthcare, and socioeconomic stability.
  - Geographically represented using **GIS (Geographic Information System)** technology.
  - An **interactive web map** is provided for accessible and intuitive data visualization.

- **GIS and Geo-Data Techniques**:
  - Ties data to specific locations or areas on a map for spatial analysis.
  - Highlights patterns not apparent in traditional data tables.
  - Visualizes demographic characteristics such as:
    - Income levels
    - Age distribution
    - Housing density
  - Enables policymakers and urban planners to:
    - Identify and prioritize resources for vulnerable communities.
    - Make actionable decisions based on zip code-level data.
  - Protects individual privacy while providing specific insights.

- **Repository Contents**:
  - Interactive map
  - Source data
  - Analysis tools

These tools and insights are crucial for addressing disparities in resilience and ensuring equitable resource allocation.
